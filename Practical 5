*Theory:
  
   Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block ( SMB )
   and Common Internet File System ( CIFS ) protocols that provides file and 
   print services between clients across various operating systems.
   In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the samba package provides the Samba server.

   Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix.
   Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all 
   clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2,
    Linux and many others.











*Steps:

step1:- To Install Samba Server:

~$ sudo apt-get -y install samba

step2:-Start samba service:

~$ sudo systemctl start smbd

step3:-check the status samba service:

~$ sudo systemctl status smbd

step4:-start nmbd service:

~$ sudo systemctl start nmbd

step5:-start nmbd service:

~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

step6:-samba_shared directory in /home/pankali        ----(#creating a new directory )

~$ mkdir samba_shared  

      

step7:-create one or two txt  files in /home/pankali/samba_shared 

$ cd samba_shared

~/samba_shared$ touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

step8:-go to samba folder 

~$ cd /etc/samba

~$ ls /etc/samba

step9:-backup smb.conf 

~$ cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 

step10:-now configuration in /etc/smb.conf

~$ sudo nano smb.conf

step11:-Then delete all the smb.conf and then write:

    [samba_shared]

	comment = welcpome pankaj  in samba	path = /home/pankali/samba_shared

	browseable = yes

	read only = yes

	guest ok = no

 *ctrl x and then y and save the file.* 

step12:-Now, smbclient if not there then the command is:

$ sudo apt-get -y install smbclient

 

step13:-start/stop services of smbd and nmbd

~$ sudo systemctl start smbd

~$ sudo systemctl stop nmbd

step14:-now check 

 ~$ whoami

step15:- 

 ~$ sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)

step16:-Type and retype your password:

~$ sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)

step17:-This will make any connectionn possible to connect:

$ sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba

        In my case it was:

~$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any app Samba

step18:-To check for your ip then use this command : 

 ~$ ip a 

step19:- Now to reload your firewall use:

  ~$ sudo ufw reload  

step20:-To check whether it's working or not, use:

$ sudo smbclient -U <username> -L  //your ip

        In my case it was:

~$ sudo smbcllient -U pankali -L  //192.168.56.101

step21:- Now restart both smbd and nmbd services:

~$ sudo systemctl restart smbd

~$ sudo systemctl restart nmbd

step22:- Do also check their status 

~$ sudo systemctl status smbd

~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

*Windows OS Part:

- Once smbd and nmbd services are active now switch back to your windows OS and press windows + R key on keyboard and 

   now a pop up box will open and their write smbclient ip address, 

   here in my case it was //192.168.56.101 and press OK.

-Now again one more pop up box will open, write the credentials of your Windows or Kali or whatever it would be.

- Now in top of the address bar you can see Network > 192.168.56.101 (your ip address)

   in this you can see samba_shared and documents folder.

- In samba_shared server you can see all the txt files that we've made earlier, using touch command.

-Once all your samba_shared files are visible in windows, then the sharing of files/folders have been 

   successfully done between Windows and Kali Linux.
